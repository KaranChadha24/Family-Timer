# Family-Timer
Project to learn about WebDev and deployment
<br>
This project of mine is to learn about how html , css and js work together and how we deploy a website to make these run together and make it available for others to use
<br>
<p>
  This is a regular timer , one made with JS , nothing too complex , just photos of my family in the BG with timers to use for productivity and motivation to continue.
